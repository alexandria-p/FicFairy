"""Say a new release is out: on Bluesky by the deploy, on X by its owner, by hand.

The post is the same on both sites but for its last line:

    v1.2.3 is live 🪄
    <the release note>
    ↪ https://github.com/alexandria-p/ficfairy/releases/latest     (X: it counts any link as 23)
    ↪ Get it here✨                                                (Bluesky: the words are the link)

**Bluesky** is posted to by the deploy (`deploy-hosted.yml`'s `announce` job) once the release's
three app zips are published, when `BLUESKY_HANDLE` and `BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD` are set. Nothing
secret is printed. **X is never posted to by anything here** - its API now costs money, and a
script signing in with a password breaks its rules - so `preview` prints a link to X's own
compose page with the post written in (`x_intent_link`), for its owner to open and post once the
release is out. It is shown when they are asked to approve a merge's release note.

The release note is `.github/release-note.txt`, written for every pull request (see CLAUDE.md's
conventions). It is never cut short: `check` refuses a note that would not fit either site, and a
test runs it on the committed note, so one too long cannot be merged. A release whose note is the
same as the release before it - a push straight to main that did not write one - says
`FALLBACK_NOTE` instead on Bluesky, rather than announcing the last change twice.

**A release can go out unannounced**: a pull request whose release note is `SKIP_NOTE`
(`no-post`) and nothing else is not posted to Bluesky, and `preview` offers no X link for it.

    python announce.py check                      # does the committed note fit?
    python announce.py preview [--version 1.2.3]  # both posts, and the link to post on X
    python announce.py post --version 1.2.3 [--previous-note-file path]
    python announce.py release-notes --version 1.2.3  # the GitHub release's description

**The GitHub release's description** (`release_body`) is the same for every release - how to
install the app on each system - with the note Bluesky was given at the bottom, under "What's
new". A release that is not announced (`SKIP_NOTE`) has no "What's new". The three app builds
write it with `release-notes`, whichever of them makes the release first.
