"""A date guessed from a file's name is never taken as the truth.

Only a date written the app's way - a space, then YYYY-MM-DD, ending the name
(`parse_text.get_date_from_filename`, the page's `dateFromFilename`) - says which version a file
holds. Anything read more loosely (`parse_text.infer_date_from_filename`, the page's `inferDate`)
is a guess: it may be shown to the reader, labelled as a guess, and used to word a recommendation
they then choose on - but nothing may decide, replace, delete or rank on it unasked.

The unindexed-copy question once read guessed dates and called them the date in the file's name,
from reaching for the loose reader where only the strict one belongs. These tests hold every place
a guess may be read to a short list, so a new one has to be argued for here, by name, rather than
slip in. Resolve issues is the one place guesses are read on purpose - it is the reader's own tool
for sorting and dating their files - and its readers are listed below as such.
